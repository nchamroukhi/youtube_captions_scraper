"hello friends and welcome to geeks for"
"geeks in this tutorial we will learn how"
"to reverse a stack using recursion so"
"here is the problem we have to reverse a"
"stack and we are not allowed to use"
"loops like while four etc we can use"
"functions of stacks like is empty push"
"and pop the idea of the solution is to"
"hold all the values and function call"
"stack until the start becomes empty when"
"the start becomes empty we insert all"
"the hell values one by one at the bottom"
"of the start let us now look at how it"
works
"let us assume our stag as 1 2 3 4 with 1"
"at top we pop all the values 1 by 1 and"
"hold all of them in function call stack"
"until this side becomes empty so here we"
"go we pop all the values until the side"
"becomes empty so a function called stag"
"in order is 4 3 2 and 1"
"since the stack is empty now we need to"
"insert all the hello elements one by one"
"at the bottom of stack now how to insert"
"elements at the bottom of stack to do so"
"we first pop all the elements and hold"
"their values in function call stack"
"until the start is empty then we push"
"the element that was supposed to be"
"inserted at the bottom and then we push"
"all the elements back let's see how it"
works
"since the stack is empty now we push the"
"first element and function called stack"
"that is 4 so the stack now becomes 4 I'd"
"talk now we need to insert 3 at the end"
"according to the algorithm we pop the"
"entire stack and hold its value in the"
"function called stack then we push the"
"element to be inserted at the end so we"
"pop 4 and push 3 that is the next"
"element in the function call stack so a"
"stack becomes 3 at top now we push back"
"all the elements and function called"
"stack that is element which just popped"
"so we push four"
"so our staff becomes 4 3 with 4 at the"
"top now we need to insert the next held"
"value in the function call such that is"
"to putting to the algorithm we need to"
"pop 4 and 3 and then push 2 at the top"
"now we will push back the elements we"
"just popped so our stack becomes 4 3 2"
"similarly we insert 1 and we can clearly"
"see that the stack of the worst let us"
"now look at the implementation this code"
"has been taken from geeks for geeks"
"website the function reverse reverses"
"the stack in this function if the stack"
"is not empty we hold all the items in"
"the function called stack until we reach"
"the end of stack then we insert all"
"these items one by one at the bottom of"
"stack using insert add bottom function"
"the function insert at bottom insert an"
"element at the bottom of stack if the"
"stack is empty we push the element at"
"the top else we pop and hold all the"
"values in function call stack until we"
"reach end of the sack when the start"
"becomes empty this statement again"
"becomes foo and the element is inserted"
"then we push back all the elements that"
"we just popped that is the elements held"
"in the function call stack that's it for"
"this tutorial thank you for watching"
"please leave as she likes and comments"
